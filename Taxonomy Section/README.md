# Labeling_Results

Here is the replication package for the Taxonomy Labeling process for the paper, "MT4RL: a Mutation Tool for Deep Reinforcement Learning based on a Taxonomy of Real Faults"

This repository contains the following files - 

1. Final_Labeling.csv - This contains the final dataset of StackExchange and GitHub posts that were used to build the taxonomy.

2. line_numbers.csv - This file contains the relevant excerpts from each post. These excertps were largely contributed to the label assigned to the post.

3. Label_Description.csv - This file contains the descriptions of the labels created by the labellers. We also used some labels from [1].
